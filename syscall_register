RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, R9, XMM0â€“7
arguments are passed on the registers rdi, rsi, rdx, r10, r8 and r9

RAX, RBX, RCX, RDX, RBP, RSI, RDI, and RSP. R8-R15. By
replacing the initial R with an E on the first eight registers, it is
possible to access the lower 32 bits (EAX for RAX). Similarly, for
RAX, RBX, RCX, and RDX, access to the lower 16 bits is possible by
removing the initial R (AX for RAX), and the lower byte of the these
by switching the X for L (AL for AX), and the higher byte of the low
16 bits using an H (AH for AX). The new registers R8 to R15 can be
accessed in a similar manner like this: R8 (qword), R8D (lower dword),
R8W (lowest word), R8B (lowest byte MASM style, Intel style R8L). Note
there is no R8H.
